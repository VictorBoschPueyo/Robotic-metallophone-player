This repository presents an automated system developed for the interpretation of musical scores by using computer vision techniques and path planners. The main objective is to capture an image of a sheet music using a camera, process it using computer vision algorithms, distribute the notes to be played on the different actuators in an optimal way and execute the movements to be able to interpret it. This process is carried out using a Raspberry Pi 4B as a processing platform that sends the coded information to an Arduino UNO board that acts as a controller.
